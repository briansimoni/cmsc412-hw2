# CMSC 412 HW2

## Compile/Usage Instructions

You will need to have [Go](https://golang.org) installed to compile from source code.
Once you have Go installed, you can:

`go build`
and then
`./cmsc412-hw2`

It will try to read in graph.txt from the present working directory and output closeness.txt in the same directory.

Here is the link to download Go

If you don't feel like downloading them, I've compiled the executables for a couple different operating systems. You can get them from the zip file submitted with the assignment, or from Github.
